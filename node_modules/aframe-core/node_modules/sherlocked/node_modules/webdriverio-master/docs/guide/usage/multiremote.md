title: WebdriverIO - Multiremote
---

Run multiple browser at the same time
=====================================

WebdriverIO allows you to run multiple Selenium sessions in a single test. This becomes handy when you
need to test application features where multiple users are required (e.g. chat or WebRTC applications).
Instead of creating a couple of remote instances where you need to execute common commands like [init](http://webdriver.io/api/protocol/init.html)
or [url](http://webdriver.io/api/protocol/url.html) on each of those instances, you can simply create a
multiremote instance and control all browser at the same time. To do so just use the `multiremote`
function and pass an object with named browser with their capabilities into it. By giving each capability
a name you will be able to easy select and access that single instance when executing commands on a single
instance.

```js
var webdriverio = require('webdriverio');
var browser = webdriverio.multiremote({
    myChromeBrowser: {
        desiredCapabilities: {
            browserName: 'chrome'
        }
    },
    myFirefoxBrowser: {
        desiredCapabilities: {
            browserName: 'firefox'
        }
    }
});
```

This would create two Selenium sessions with Chrome and Firefox. All commands you call with the
`browser` variable gets executed in parallel with each browser. This helps to streamline your
integration test and speedup the execution a bit.

```js
browser.init().url('http://chat.socket.io/');
```

Using the multiremote instance changes the way how results are accessible in callback functions.
Since more than one browser executes the command we also receive more than one result.

```js
browser
    .init()
    .url('https://www.whatismybrowser.com/')
    .getText('.string-major', function(err, text) {
        console.log(text);
        // returns:
        // { 
        //     myFirefoxBrowser: 'Firefox 35 on Mac OS X (Yosemite)',
        //     myChromeBrowser: 'Chrome 40 on Mac OS X (Yosemite)'
        // }
    })
    .end();
```

You will notice that each command gets executed one by one. That means that the command finishes once
all browser have executed it. This is helpful because it keeps the browser actions synced and it makes
it easier to understand what currently happens.

Sometimes it is necessary to do different things with each browser in order to test something. For instance
if we want to test a chat application, there has to be one browser who inputs a text message while the
other browser waits to receive that message and do an assertion on it. You can get access to a single instance
by using the `select` method.

```js
var myChromeBrowser = browser.select('myChromeBrowser');
var myFirefoxBrowser = browser.select('myFirefoxBrowser');
 
myChromeBrowser
    .setInput('#message', 'Hi, I am Chrome')
    .click('#send');
 
myFirefoxBrowser
    .waitForExist('.messages', 5000)
    .getText('.messages', function(err, messages) {
        assert.ok(err);
        assert.equal(messages, 'Hi, I am Chrome');
    });
```

In that example the `myFirefoxBrowser` instance will start waiting on messages once the `myChromeBrowser`
instance clicked on the send button. The execution is not in parallel. Multiremote makes it easy and
convenient to control multiple browser either doing the same thing in parallel or something different
in order. You will never have to care about racing conditions since every Selenium commands gets pushed
into a single execution queue. Once you explicitly use one browser instance to execute a command all other
browser will wait until that command finishes.

```js
// these commands get executed in parallel by all defined instances
browser.init().url('http://example.com');

// do something with the Chrome browser
myChromeBrowser.setValue('.chatMessage', 'Hey Whats up!').keys('Enter')

// do something with the Firefox browser
myFirefoxBrowser.getText('.message', function(err, message) {
    console.log(messages);
    // returns: "Hey Whats up!"
});
```

__Note:__ Multiremote is not meant to execute all your tests in parallel. Since all instances wait until the
last browser has executed the command you wouldn't get any performance imrpovements. It should help you to
coordinate more than one browser for sophisticated integration tests.
