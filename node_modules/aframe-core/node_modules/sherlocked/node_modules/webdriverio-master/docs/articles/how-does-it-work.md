## How does it work?

WebdriverIO is an open source testing utility for nodejs. It makes it possible
to write super easy selenium tests with Javascript in your favorite BDD or TDD
test framework. Even Cucumber tests are supported.

It basically sends requests to a Selenium server via the [WebDriver Wire Protocol](https://code.google.com/p/selenium/wiki/JsonWireProtocol#Command_Reference)
and handles with its response. These requests are wraped in useful commands, which
provides callbacks to test several aspects of your site in an automated way.
